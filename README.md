# Startpage `V1.0`
Custom startpage for your browser.

Very simple. HTML + CSS and a bit of JS. Lot of space for links.<br>
Features a clock, some button shenanigans and a randomized motd (message of the day).  

Html should be easy to understand and to change.
The css has some global values to make your life a bit easier customizing it.

The motd.js could relatively easy be refunctioned to change the image on page load.<br>
Maybe I'll do that someday. (Same for the gretting / title)
